Hi Everyone, I am Sanjay.This is my short information about myself. The words are dedicated to my beautiful family. First of all, I would like to pray to my 1st God my father and my mother who brought me in this beautiful world. Because of him I saw this environment as a background in my life. Secondly, I would like to pray to my 2nd God and Goddess who made me for my parent as a lovely son. Because of you my lord I have seen my 1st God as you. In continue my life I found myself very happy to get three sisters and one lovely brother. They are special part of my life.I  got so much affection and love from my respected sisters. And also found so much affection and getting respect from my younger brother. In this duration of my life I got a special gift from my god who gave me much more beautiful wife and daughter too. I am glad to say my life partner is that a girl who completely changed my life into a perfect man. I feel proud to say that I am a good father of my lovely daughter. </p>
